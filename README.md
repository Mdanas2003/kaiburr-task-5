#  Kaiburr Task 5 - Text Classification

##  Objective

To build a multiclass text classification model that categorizes consumer complaints into the following 4 categories:

1. Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports
2. Debt collection
3. Consumer Loan
4. Mortgage

##  Dataset

Source: [Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database)  
File: `complaints.csv`  
Sampled 100,000 rows from a 1.2GB file for efficiency.

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- TF-IDF for feature extraction

##  Preprocessing

- Lowercasing
- Removing punctuation & digits
- Removing stopwords
- TF-IDF vectorization (`max_features=5000`)

##  Models Trained

| Model              | Accuracy | Notes                              |
|-------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| LogisticRegression | 92%      |  Best overall performer           |
| Naive Bayes        | 90%      | Performs okay, lower on class 2    |
| Random Forest      | 93%      | But fails on class 2 (0 recall)  |

## Final Evaluation (Logistic Regression)

Accuracy: 92%
Class 0 (Credit reporting): F1 = 0.95
Class 1 (Debt collection): F1 = 0.84
Class 2 (Consumer Loan): F1 = 0.44
Class 3 (Mortgage): F1 = 0.93
